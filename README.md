# SteelSeries Weather Gauges extension #

A weeWX extension for the *SteelSeries Weather Gauges*.

## Description ##

The *SteelSeries Weather Gauges* extension provides an automated installation and default setup of the [SteelSeries Weather Gauges used with weeWX](https://github.com/mcrossley/SteelSeries-Weather-Gauges/tree/master/weather_server/WeeWX).

## Pre-Requisites ##

The *SteelSeries Weather Gauges* extension requires *weewx v3.4.0* or greater.

**Note:** Symbolic names are used in this document to refer to some file locations on the weeWX system. These symbolic names allow a common name to be used to refer to a directory that may be different from system to system. The following symbolic names are used in this document:

*$DOWNLOAD_ROOT*. The path to the directory containing the downloaded Highcharts for weewx extension.

*$HTML_ROOT*. The path to the directory where weewx generated reports are saved. This directory is normally set in the *[StdReport]* section of *weewx.conf*. Refer to [where to find things](http://weewx.com/docs/usersguide.htm#Where_to_find_things) in the weewx [User's Guide](http://weewx.com/docs/usersguide.htm) for further information.

## Installation ##

The preferred method to install the *SteelSeries Weather Gauges* extension is to use the *wee\_extension* utility as follows:

1.  Download the latest *SteelSeries Weather Gauges* extension from the [weewx-steelseries releases page](https://github.com/gjr80/weewx-steelseries_gauges/releases) into a directory accessible from the weeWX machine:

        $ wget -P $DOWNLOAD_ROOT https://github.com/gjr80/weewx-steelseries/releases/download/v2.6.1/steelseries-2.6.1.tar.gz

    where *$DOWNLOAD_ROOT* is the path to the directory where the *SteelSeries Weather Gauges* extension is to be downloaded.

2.  Stop weeWX:

        $ sudo /etc/init.d/weewx stop

    or

        $ sudo service weewx stop

3.  Install the *SteelSeries Weather Gauges* extension downloaded at step 1 using the *wee\_extension* utility:

        $ wee_extension --install=$DOWNLOAD_ROOT/steelseries-2.6.1.tar.gz

    this will result in output similar to the following:

        Request to install '/var/tmp/steelseries-2.6.1.tar.gz'
        Extracting from tar archive /var/tmp/steelseries-2.6.1.tar.gz
        Saving installer file to /home/weewx/bin/user/installer/SteelSeries
        Saved configuration dictionary. Backup copy at /home/weewx/weewx.conf.20170320124410
        Finished installing extension '/var/tmp/steelseries-2.6.1.tar.gz'

4.  The *gauge-data.txt* file generated by the *SteelSeries Weather Gauges* extension defaults to Metric units for all observations except *cloudbase*. To change the units used in *gauge-data.txt*:

    -   edit *weewx.conf*:

            $ vi weewx.conf

    -   locate the *[StdReport]*, *[[SteelSeries]]*, *[[[Units]]]*, *[[[[Groups]]]]* stanza and change the settings as required:

            [StdReport]
                ....
                [[SteelSeries]]
                    ....
                    [[[Units]]]
                        ....
                        [[[[Groups]]]]
                            group_temperature = degree_C
                            group_altitude = foot
                            group_pressure = hPa
                            group_rain = mm
                            group_rainRate = mm_per_hour
                            group_speed = km_per_hour

        **Note:** The units used in *gauge-data.txt* merely set the initial units displayed by the *SteelSeries Gauges*. The *SteelSeries Gauges* include a number of option selectors that set the displayed units. Once these options are set the displayed units will remain as set irrespective of the units used in *gauge-data.txt*.

    -   save *weewx.conf*

5.  Start weeWX:

        $ sudo /etc/init.d/weewx start

    or

        $ sudo service weewx start

This will result in weeWX generating the weeWX *SteelSeries Weather Gauges* data file (*gauge-data.txt*) and a demonstration page displaying the *Steel Series Weather Gauges* (*index.html*) each report cycle. The generated files can be found in the *$HTML\_ROOT/ss* directory. The demonstration page can be displayed in a browser by pointing it at *$HTML\_ROOT/ss/index.html*.

The *SteelSeries Weather Gauges* JavaScript and CSS files are copied to the *$HTML\_ROOT/ss* directory during the first report cycle after weeWX is started.

If the *SteelSeries Weather Gauges* are to be served by a remote web server then the contents of the *$HTML\_ROOT/ss* directory will need to be transferred from the weeWX server to the remote server using the FTP or RSYNC skins of via some other external means.
